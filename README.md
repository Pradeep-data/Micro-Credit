# Micro-Credit

A Microfinance Institution (MFI) is an organization that offers financial services to low income populations. MFS becomes very useful when targeting especially the unbanked poor families living in remote areas with not much sources of income. The Microfinance services (MFS) provided by MFI are Group Loans, Agricultural Loans, Individual Business Loans and so on. 
Many microfinance institutions (MFI), experts and donors are supporting the idea of using mobile financial services (MFS) which they feel are more convenient and efficient, and cost saving, than the traditional high-touch model used since long for the purpose of delivering microfinance services. Though, the MFI industry is primarily focusing on low income families and are very useful in such areas, the implementation of MFS has been uneven with both significant challenges and successes.
